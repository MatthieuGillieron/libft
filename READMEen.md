# Libft - Custom C Library  

The project involves reimplementing **34 essential functions** that are typically found in the C standard library. This includes functions for:  

- **Manipulating strings:** `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, etc.  
- **Managing memory:** `ft_memset`, `ft_calloc`, etc.  
- **Converting data:** `ft_atoi`, `ft_itoa`, etc.  

The goal is to create a **static library (`libft.a`)** that can be used in my other projects at **42**.
